;; ---------------------------------------------------------
;; There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
;; There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
;; There is society, where none intrudes,
;; By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
;; I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
;; From these our interviews, in which I steal
;; From all I may be, or have been before,
;; To mingle with the Universe, and feel
;; What I can neâ€™er express, yet cannot all conceal.
;;
;;       - Lord Byron, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage
